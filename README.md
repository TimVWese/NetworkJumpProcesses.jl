# NetworkJumpProcesses.jl
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://timvwese.github.io/NetworkJumpProcesses.jl/dev/)

Julia package to facilitate the construction of JumpProblems on graphs.
The idea is that the relationship between this package and the [JumpProcesses.jl](https://github.com/SciML/JumpProcesses.jl) package is similar to the relationship between [NetworkDynamics.jl](https://github.com/PIK-ICoNe/NetworkDynamics.jl) and [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).
