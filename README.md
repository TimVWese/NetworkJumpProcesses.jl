# NetworkJumpProcesses.jl

Julia package to facilitate the construction of JumpProblems on graphs.
The idea is that the relationship between this package and the [JumpProcesses.jl](https://github.com/SciML/JumpProcesses.jl) package is similar to the relationship between [NetworkDynamics.jl](https://github.com/PIK-ICoNe/NetworkDynamics.jl) and [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).
